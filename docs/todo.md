# Things todo

## Authentication

- Already done, but refine.

## Home Page?
- something static, something quick that can be put up to work with the auth system

## Admin side
- Chris- set yourself up as a superuser so you can login to http://server/admin.
- cd into _djangocore and run python manage.py createsuperuser --username=username --email=email
- it will prompt for password, enter it twice, and you're all good to go!
